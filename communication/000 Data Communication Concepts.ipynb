    "\n",
    "The data storytelling road:\n",
    "\n",
    "  Story > Tech or not tech > data > viz > present\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need stories?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best results could have no impact without proper presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge is to convince stakeholders that things have to be done differently, specially if these stakeholders are non technical or dont feel confortable with math or statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is data storytelling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data storytelling is the practice of building a narrative around a set of data and its accompanying visualizations to help convey the meaning of that data in a powerful and compelling fashion\n",
    "\n",
    "Anecdotes -> peoples impagination\n",
    "\n",
    "Stories are more memorable than metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "And they add value giving context to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The attention of the audience is then captured facilitating the decision making and thereforem drive change through actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to build an effective data story?abs\n",
    "There are two main concepts that will help us articulate our story in a clear and concice manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The 3 minutes story\n",
    "What would we focus on if we have only 3 minutes to tell our story?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Big Idea\n",
    "Unique point of view and one single sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements will help us creating a story thats:\n",
    "- Insightful\n",
    "- Explanatory\n",
    "- Concise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "To build an effective story we should include only findings from our models and analysis that apply to the situation. They have to be relevant. Our story has to be accurate and reliable, based on our results. our story has to have actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Narrative\n",
    "A good story has to be compelling and easy to understand including only the key points required to drive change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid including disconnected facts and try to keep it turning around a central insight, taking into account our intended audience and their background so we can clarify facts for them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every data story follows a linear sequence, so each data point is connected till the conclusion is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visuals\n",
    "Graphs should be simple, engaging and not misleading"

    "## How technical our audience is?\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplification we are considering here technical or non technical audiences, while the reality doesnt go black or white but more like a continuum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data professionals like to care about the methods, while the audience tends to care more about results and implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translating technical results into stories\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to explain the technical results to a non technical audience in an engaging and easy to understand fashion we need to use common terms that will enable decision making and drive change.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several strategies to accomplish this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Awareness of our audience\n",
    "- What do they know? -> adjust the content\n",
    "- What do they need to know to understand? -> Be conversational\n",
    "- What level of information do they need? -> Our story should be able to make the audience understand what our project is about\n",
    "\n",

    "- Analogy: the audience can relate new things they are not familiar with to other stuff they already know\n",
    "- Diagram: \n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "- Plain English:\n",
    "- Technical definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Special attention to acronyms. They can be helpful if everybody understands them. Good practice to explain them the first time its used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid the use of jargon. Include a guide or definitions to our report is a good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus on Impact\n",

    "\n",
    "After finding insights worth sharing, we have to build a meaningful narrative for the target audience. Prioritize key points so we can drive change.\n",
