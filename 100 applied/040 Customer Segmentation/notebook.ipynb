It helps understanding the high level trends better by providing insights on metrics across both the product and the customer lifecycle.\n",

    "## Time cohorts\n",
    "Customers who signed up for a product or service during a particular time frame. Analyzing these cohorts shows the customers bhaviour depending on the time they started using the companys  prdocuts or services. The time can be monthly, quarterly or even daily.\n",

    "## Behaviour cohorts\n",
    "Customers who purchased a product or subscribed to a service in the past. It groups customers by the type of product or service they signed up: those signing for basic level service may have a different behaviour than the ones going premium. Understanding the needs of various cohorts can help a company design customed-made services or products for particular segments.\n",

    "## Size cohorts\n",
    "Refers to the various sizes of customers who purchase companys products or services. This categorization can be based on the amount of spending in some period of  time after acquisition or the product type that the customer spent most of their order amount in some period of time.\n",
