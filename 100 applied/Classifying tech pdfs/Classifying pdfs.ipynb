As the study of matrices and operations acting\\nupon them, linear algebra is the mathematical basis of nearly all\\nalgorithms and analyses implemented in computers. But the way it's\\npresented in decades-old textbooks is much different from how professionals\\nuse linear algebra today to solve real-world modern applications. This\\npractical guide from Mike X Cohen teaches the core concepts of linear\\nalgebra as implemented in Python, including how they're used in data\\nscience, machine learning, deep learning, computational simulations, and\\nbiomedical data processing applications. Armed with knowledge from this\\nbook, you'll be able to understand, implement, and adapt myriad modern\\nanalysis methods and algorithms. Ideal for practitioners and students using\\ncomputer technology and algorithms, this book introduces you to: The\\ninterpretations and applications of vectors and matrices Matrix arithmetic\\n(various multiplications and transformations) Independence, rank, and\\ninverses Important decompositions used in applied linear algebra (including\\nLU and QR) Eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition Applications\\nincluding least-squares model fitting and principal components analysis\", 'metadata': {'ISBN-13': '9781098120610', 'Title': 'Practical Linear Algebra For Data Science - From Core Concepts To Applications Using Python', 'Authors': ['MIKE.

In this second edition,\\nrenamed to reflect the increased coverage of machine-learning data mining\\ntechniques, the author has completely revised, reorganized, and\\nrepositioned the original chapters and produced 14 new chapters of creative\\nand useful machine-learning data mining techniques. In sum, the 31 chapters\\nof simple yet insightful quantitative techniques make this book unique in\\nthe field of data mining literature. The statistical data mining methods\\neffectively consider big data for identifying structures (variables) with\\nthe appropriate predictive power in order to yield reliable and robust\\nlarge-scale statistical models and analyses. In contrast, the author's own\\nGenIQ Model provides machine-learning solutions to common and virtually\\nunapproachable statistical problems. GenIQ makes this possible — its\\nutilitarian data mining features start where statistical data mining stops.\\nThis book contains essays offering detailed background, discussion, and\\nillustration of specific methods for solving the most commonly experienced\\nproblems in predictive modeling and analysis of big data. They address each\\nmethodology and assign its application to a specific type of problem. To\\nbetter ground readers, the book provides an in-depth discussion of the\\nbasic methodologies of predictive modeling and analysis.

In this practical book, author Kyran Dale\\nshows data scientists and analysts--as well as Python and JavaScript\\ndevelopers--how to create the ideal toolchain for the job. By providing\\nengaging examples and stressing hard-earned best practices, this guide\\nteaches you how to leverage the power of best-of-breed Python and\\nJavaScript libraries. Python provides accessible, powerful, and mature\\nlibraries for scraping, cleaning, and processing data. And while JavaScript\\nis the best language when it comes to programming web visualizations, its\\ndata processing abilities can't compare with Python's. Together, these two\\nlanguages are a perfect complement for creating a modern web-visualization\\ntoolchain. This book gets you started. You'll learn how to: Obtain data you\\nneed programmatically, using scraping tools or web APIs: Requests, Scrapy,\\nBeautiful Soup Clean and process data using Python's heavyweight data\\nprocessing libraries within the NumPy ecosystem: Jupyter notebooks with\\npandas+Matplotlib+Seaborn Deliver the data to a browser with static files\\nor by using Flask, the lightweight Python server, and a RESTful API Pick up\\nenough web development skills (HTML, CSS, JS) to get your visualized data\\non the web Use the data you've mined and refined to create web charts and\\nvisualizations with Plotly, D3, Leaflet, and other libraries\",\n",
